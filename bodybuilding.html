    <h3>Bodybuilding</h3>
    <h4>Typical training</h4>
    <p>
       The typical body-build training involves <b>isolation</b> exercises, using loose weights as well as machines. There is a great focus on a <b>high time-under-tension</b>, so that the blood flow to the isolated muscle increases. This is how a bodybuild(st)er in some way “sculpts” the body. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Above described training focuses on the toning of a specific muscle. But for these that also want a lot of muscle mass, <b>compound exercises</b> do the trick. This means using loose weights, combined with doing exercises that activate the <b>large muscle-groups</b>. The squat, bench, deadlift, heavy rows and overhead presses are examples of recommended movements to activate and train these big muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Summarized</b>: your typical training will involve a lot of muscle isolation, combined with compound exercises (prioritized by <a href="powerlifting.html">Powerlifters</a>).
    </p>
    <h4>Expectations</h4>
    <p>
        The name says it all. When bodybuilding, the lift(st)er expects to build an <b>aesthetic</b> pleasing body. This usually involves muscle-building combined with having a low <b>body-fat percentage</b> so that the built muscle shows.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may expect to put a great emphasis on <b>dieting</b>, as well as on training. Choose one and you will get some results. Choose both and you will have amazing results. It’s a hard job and you have to be very consistent. But as you already made it this far and considering that you are visiting the <b>Gymdex</b>, you probably are very motivated! If you are just starting out or you’re just having a rough time, it might be useful to focus on <b>training first</b>. You could soon find yourself in a situation where dieting will be a small task considering the pleasing results that you could show off. After all, you’ve already worked for it so hard!
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            On body-fat: More advanced bodybuilders will usually alternate between moderate to very low percentages. When they have to show, they want to keep their percentage as low as possible. For more training-energy and faster recuperation, they keep a moderate (or less low) percentage that they will try to decrease a few months before the big moment.
        </i>
    </p>
    
    <h4>Training programs</h4>
    <p>
        There are so many ways to tackle your physique in the gym. So as far as programming goes, you can reach your ideal body with lifts from other sports that are mentioned above, as long as you combine it with having a low fat percentage.
    </p>
    <p>
        That being said, there are <b>typical bodybuilding programs</b> that focuses on building mass, as well as isolating certain muscles. A beginner program (that skips on compound exercises) can be found <a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/beginners-bodybuilding-program-a-step-by-step-introduction-to-the-iron-game.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
        We feel like this program has a <b>great basis</b>, being an “upper-lower split” program where you basically train the lower body one day and the upper body the other day (it doesn’t really matter which one first). thereafter, you take a rest day and then you start all over again with upper-lower. And after that, you can take the weekend off!
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>
            The reason why we said it’s a great basis, is because you can alternate exercises (of which a variety you can find <a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/" target="_blank">here</a>) but keep the upper-lower-split-system, as it is used not only for beginners, but is also a great system for more advanced bodybuilders.

    <h4>Sports clothing and equipment</h4>
    <p>
        If you start out, you don’t need specific clothing or advanced equipment. Normal sports clothing will do just fine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tips:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you do squats and/or deadlifts it is recommended to wear <b>shoes</b> with a flat sole that is as hard as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you start doing heavier weights that start to affect your core stability, you could wear a <b>belt</b>. The typical powerlifting belt is recommended and not the tiny ones that go smaller at the front side of the belt.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>The Gym</h4>
    <p>
        Most <b>commercial gyms</b> are equipped with the <b>right stuff</b> to do bodybuilding. They usually have loose weights for the big muscle groups and machines for specific isolation. Although when no machines are around, there are still options enough to isolate a muscle-group with loose weights. It just takes more concentration and demands a high level of good form.
    </p>
    <h4>Foods and Diets</h4>
    <p>
        As being said already: for bodybuilding, the body-fat percentage is key. This basically makes your diet key too. So if you really want to show off that muscle, it is necessary to take your diet serious.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although seeing a dietitian might be the best option, it is certainly not the cheapest. What <b>we think</b> is the most <b>easy and efficient</b> option is to set a certain body-fat percentage goal (that % can be measured with certain body scales or a trough calculation with a manual “skinfold caliper” that are often sold for a few euro’s or USD) and then you work with a diet that has enough proteins, minerals and vitamins in it. See if you are going toward your chosen % every month or so, and if not: cut some excessive calories by leaving out foods that are low in needed nutrients (and high in calories).
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to get to that <b>next level</b>, we can recommend a low-carb diet (but high in protein and fat). In case of the next-next level, a <a href="https://www.ruled.me/guide-keto-diet/" target="_blank">ketogenic diet</a> works magic (but it’s hard).
    </p>
    
    <h4>More info and sources</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Youtube is a great place to wander around in search for exercises and instructions. But it is also a place where a lot of confusing or simply wrong content is posted. An all-time <b>Gymdex favorite</b> for bodybuilders is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/icecream4PRs" target="_blank">Jeff Nippard’s YouTube-channel</a> which is science-based. Go take a look!
        </li>
        <li>
            Although bodybuilding.com can be a little overwhelming and the products advertised there are out of a pure profit-oriented perspective, they do have a great <a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/" target="_blank">catalog</a> of exercises for each selected muscle-group.
