        <h4>Why Gymdex?</h4>
        <p>
            Because Gymdex is a collection of <b>experiences</b> and <b>knowledge</b> of lifters and gym’ers that have found the right sport or gym activity for them. This way we hope to lead you to the right sport or the right combination of exercises for you. If there are any products that get recommended, it means that the lifters who preform the sport in question, uses that product from that specific store him- or herself. This means that the right balance between price and quality will always be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            We practice what we preach: If another source or product is more useful or better in quality, the post will be adjusted so that the product mentioned will always be the one that the author would go for. This means that what looks like advertisement, is actually an <b>honest suggestion</b> where authenticity is central. We believe that this <b>authenticity</b> will help the beginning, average and advanced lifter with the <b>right choices</b>, which will make you -and everyone else you share this website with- succeed the best way possible. Besides that, we will try to get some extra discounts on the products that get shown on the website. Because all the little bits help.
        </p>
        
        <h4>What after I have found my sport?</h4>
        <p>
            Then you still might consider looking at <b>the other sports</b> to gain some insights in overall training or just to <b>spice up your training</b> by adding in some movements from other activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <a href="blog.html">Blog</a> section will be updated with a <b>new article every week</b>. The topics will range from basic training info and tips to advanced and scientifically supported research.
        </p>
        <p>
            What also stays applicable during your whole journey, are the gym-related products: The <a href="products.html">Products-page</a> will always be at the right corner of the screen so that you can quickly find extra and new promotions on top of the existing ones. <b>Gymdex</b> will do its very best to keep that page updated so that you can <b>come back</b> to get even more cash off of your favorite products.
